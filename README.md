# Epimetheus Ozone
# Contains both the Epimetheus script for each isotopologue and additionally in most cases a built in Pandora script to model the spectroscopic data.
# All isotopologues have corresponding spectroscopic data .csv files and spectra (transition wavenumber/intensity) .txt files.
# Need all files to run one epimetheus script -- will not work in isolation.
